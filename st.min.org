[[code://mnbuf:anchor]]

Anchors are non-textual, and may hold any kind of data. They correspond roughly to <A> tags in html.

Unlike the generic list cursors, which are pointers to link objects in the linked list, anchors are data objects that are actually part of the buffer. This is so programs that traverse the list are able to see and make use of them.

**** TODO blocks
:PROPERTIES:
:TS: <2013-01-03 03:53PM>
:ID: s5pjy4e19zf0
:END:

Blocks are spans that act like xml elements, in that they are nestable but non-overlapping, and that each node in the tree contains references to its siblings, children, and a single parent node.

Aside from these fields, blocks can be of any type, and may or may not conform to any particular schema.

Most likely they would be implemented as =type block<t>=.

These can be used to indicate parsed structures such as lines of text, tokens (for syntax highlighting), etc.

**** TODO other embedded objects
:PROPERTIES:

:ID: nrrkq600azf0
:END:

Arbitrary objects can be embedded in the text. These may contain "clones" of text elsewhere in the document (or in another document, or calculated on the fly).

They are expected to display themselves, just like textual nodes.
