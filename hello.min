Welcome to minneron. At the moment, the only thing to see here is
the text editor, which is still quite primitive.

The current keybindings are similar to those in emacs and bash:

  |Wcursor movement
  ^N : next line
  ^P : previous line
  ^U : page up
  ^V : page down
  ^B : back (left/up)
  ^F : forward (right/down)
  ^A : go to start of line
  ^E : go to end of line

  |Wediting
  ^K : delete to end of line
  ^H : backspace
  ^D : delete

  |Wfile management
  ^S : save
  ^C : exit

If you don't like these keybindings, you can edit them in |gmin.pas|w.

(Sorry, no config file yet, but stay tuned!)

For now, you can only edit one file at a time.

|WTo edit a different file:

  - SAVE with ^S (hold the control key, press S, release both)
  - QUIT with ^Q

Then, at the prompt, type:

   |W./min filename.xxx

|rNOTE: |wdue to a bug, the file must actually exist, and contain at least
one line (blank is fine) before you can edit it. To create a new file
like this, run the command:

  echo >> filename.xxx

This works on all modern operating systems.
